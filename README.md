# Description

This is a simple Object Relationship Mapping mini-framework written in Java 
that uses a small set of annotations for mapping custom classes to database 
tables.

*Custom classes must have setters and getter for the class variables for the
framework to work*

The framework uses Query Objects to interact with the database. These query
objects can be used as list to access objects (custom classes) retrieved or 
inserted to the database.
